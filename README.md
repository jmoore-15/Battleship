# Battleship
Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of the other's various ships.

The object of the game is to guess the location of the ships each player hides on a plastic grid containing vertical and horizontal space coordinates. Players take turns calling out row and column coordinates on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a square that contains a ship. 

The game board each player gets has two grids. One of the grids is used by the player to "hide" the location of his own ships, while the other grid is used to record the shots fired toward the opponent and to document whether those shots were hits or misses. The goal of the game is to sink all of the opponent's ships by correctly guessing their location on the grid. 


### To Do
1. Make it so placeShip() works for both the computer ship placement and the user ship placement.
2. Make it so that if a computers guess is a hit, it continues to guess around that hit until it sinks the ship.
3. Change up rand() to something more random (ha ha).
4. Check if the there are any memory leaks from dynamic location.
5. Comment the code a lot more for when I inevitably forget what it all means.
